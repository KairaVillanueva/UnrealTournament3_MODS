# UnrealTournament3_MODS
A collection of mods I have created for Unreal Tournament 3.

You need to have Unreal Tournament 3 downloaded before you can play these mods.

Once you have Unreal Tournament 3 downloaded, open up "my games" which
can be found in your C:\ My Documents. Once you're there, click 
Unreal Tournament 3, and then click UTGame. It will then pull up
several more direcotries, find the one that says "Published" and
inside that folder, there will be another one called "CookedPC". 
The files then are placed in this directory.

Depending on what kind of game you are playing, you can locally
start Unreal Tournament 3 and find this mod in the list of maps
in your game.

Have fun and play or share it with your friends!
